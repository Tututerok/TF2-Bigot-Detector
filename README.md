# TF2 Bigot Detector-Preventer
Useful for Twitch streamers alike and people/otherkins who don't want to be a witness of despise. Hate crimes are a direct result of hate speech, while we can't really control what people say, especially in online titles, we choose to sacrifice (voice) chat to avoid encountering horrifying words. You no longer have to with this tool, it will automatically mute people that say any kind of slurs and shut down any complex methods used to bypass it before the message even pops up. For voice chat, the delay before any sound going through must me configurated in TF2 via ConVars, we will state the console variable with exact working precise number in the future release. Safe space is going to be in Team Fortress 2, whether bigots like it or not.
