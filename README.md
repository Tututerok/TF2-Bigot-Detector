Hate crimes are a direct result of hate speech. While we can't really control what people say, especially in online titles, we choose to sacrifice the (voice) chat to avoid horrifying words. You no longer have to do it with this tool, it will automatically mute people that say any kind of slurs, even with complex methods used to bypass it. Safe space is going to be in Team Fortress 2.
